## A testing area for me to:

  - learn how to better organize my python packages
  - try to add pip installations in addition to conda
  - work towards CI stuff
  - learn how to incorporate pytest

```bash
mamba create -n conda-pip-testing -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults -c astrobiomike conda-pip-testing
```
